				<p>Before I start this, I just want to say that I am in no way affiliated with any admissions department, nor do I work for a university. Rather, this is written from what I’ve seen online, in my own experience, and with my friends as we applied to college two years ago. I applied to a lot of good schools and got accepted, rejected, and waitlisted from a ton of them. Now I attend the University of Arizona with a full ride. If you don’t believe I can provide valuable input on the subject as a U of A student, rest assured because some of my friends <em>who DO</em> attend these schools have something to add.</p>

			</div>
						<p>Outside the US, most college admissions processes are entirely number-based. You either get a top score and go to a top university, or you don’t. Some may like this, and praise it for its simplicity, while others may dismiss it as a very robotic and unfair process. The US tends to be more holistic, as in they look at things other than test scores.</p>
      <p>The problem with US college admissions is that it’s probably the first time a lot of students are being judged in a longitudinal manner. Your application is supposed to reflect three-and-a-half years of effort and committment to school. Most 17-18 year olds are used to being given things to do and moving on provided they did the work. Most of the assignments and tasks they’ve had have clear rubrics and checklists. However, there is no rubric for getting into Harvard.</p>
      <h1 id="addressing-assumptions">Addressing Assumptions</h1>
      <h2 id="the-role-of-an-institution-in-bettering-an-individual">The Role of an Institution in Bettering an Individual</h2>
      <p>First off, don’t think you HAVE to go to a top school to get a good job. If your only goal is employment, then I don’t think you should be focusing on going to MIT or Harvard. Sure, going to a top school will help you get a good job, and it may even guarantee you a job no matter what. But that’s all it can really do. It can’t teach you to be a good person. It can’t teach you a sustainable and healthy lifestyle either.</p>
      <p>My point is: You don’t NEED to go to these schools to reap the benefits they claim to offer. In fact, you don’t need to go to college at all to do a lot of the things they offer. Want to learn something? Look it up online, take an online course. Want to “find yourself”? You don’t have to pay $50k a year to “find yourself”, get a hobby or something.</p>
      <p>Now, we all know why you really want to go to a top university. You don’t REALLY care about “finding yourself” or “contributing back to the school”, you’re just using that as a front in your application because you want a job and a ton of money. You also want to be well-respected among your peers. Let me just say that you could go to these schools and still end up dropping or burning out halfway through. Then what? You’re going to wish you’d have gone to your state university and studied the same thing there. Chances are you would end up with a similarly-paying job.</p>
      <p>Also, college is just four years of your life. Don’t cherrypick reasons to attend a school on the East Coast to fit your narrative of “self-enlightenment”. It’s just a cope to ignore the fact you have no idea how to pay for it all. The best college is the cheapest college.</p>
      <h2 id="good-and-bad-reasons-for-choosing-a-school">Good and Bad Reasons for Choosing a School</h2>
      <p>Good:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Academic program tailored to your needs</li>
      <li>They offer a good program for your degree</li>
      <li>Research opportunities</li>
      <li>Financial Aid</li>
      <li>Community and faculty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bad:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Climate, unless you have a valid medical concern</li>
      <li>Friends</li>
      <li>Significant other</li>
      <li>“The feel”</li>
      <li>Mascot</li>
      <li>Sports team</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Need I say more? Don’t make emotional decisions when choosing a college unless you’ve already exhausted the good reasons for the particular school. The bad reasons aren’t inherently bad. After all, a reason is a reason. But I would say they’re misguided reasons that you shouldn’t consider until you’ve significantly trimmed down your options.</p>
      <h2 id="well-roundedness-as-a-positive-trait">Well-Roundedness as a Positive Trait</h2>
      <p>Your counselor has probably told you that you have to be “well-rounded”, and they’re absolutely right, but not in the way you may think. When you imagine well-rounded, you picture a fit athlete who gets straight A’s and volunteers consistently while being a member of the debate team and winning all the science fairs. This is almost impossible given all the time we have in the day. But people will try anyways. And what usually happens is they decide to minimally commit to all the things they can, and never really make an impact throughout their four years of highschool.</p>
      <p>We’ve all witnessed people like this. The kid who sits in the back of all the debate team meetings and browses their phone. The one who cares enough to go to the fundraisers and parties, but doesn’t help prepare beforehand or clean up afterwards. The one posting on social media about their experiences on the team… while they’re supposed to be helping build the robot or finish a project.</p>
      <p>You don’t have to be well-rounded in all your activities, but you do have to be well-rounded in all the positive traits that your school values. One of my friends who got into MIT just coded, did math, and was a part of my robotics team. Not being in a sport didn’t matter because he demonstrated perseverance and teamwork through the robotics team. He showed how bright of a student he was through his advanced standing in math and his SAT scores. He showed his creativity and drive through his programming projects. Overall he’s a good holistic candidate and benefitted the team in many ways. That’s way better than some random guy who just chills at all the meetings and doesn’t commit all the way.</p>
      <p>More on this later though.</p>
      <h1 id="what-these-schools-want">What these Schools Want</h1>
      <p>Top schools are top schools for a reason. They produce a high volume of successful and influential people who become high-level workers and contribute greatly in their respective fields. These schools want to maximize their influence in the world, and so they will produce highly skilled and ambitious graduates. Everyone trusts publications released by these institutions because their professors are world-class. That’s a word I’m going to be using a lot.</p>
      <p><em>World-class</em> means in this context: Someone who has devoted so much time and effort to their field that their prowess is rarely rivaled. You’ll see why this is relevant.</p>
      <p>Now, given what these schools output, you know that the input (an admitted student) has to be better than the average student. You know that there’s something that sets the admits apart from the rejects. To investigate further, we need to see what the profile of an average admit looks like. Let’s take a look at some statistics across the board. How about some <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/">MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Harvard-admission-requirements">Harvard</a> admission statistics?</p>
      <p>With just two examples you kinda get the point. You don’t need to be some test-taking wizard to get in. Pay attention to those statistics. Sure, the SAT Math bottom 25th percentile for MIT was a high 790… but look at the Reading section! 25% of MIT admits got below a 730 in the Reading section of the SAT. Clearly, there was something in them that made the admissions officers say, “They’re in!”. So, we have officially dispelled the myth of needing to be a perfect test taker and absolute genius to get in.</p>
      <p>They admit people based on things other than exclusively numbers. Well, the only thing they have to judge you by is your application. What’s included in your application? Test scores, grades, essays, letters of recommendation, sometimes an interview, and maybe some extra materials or something.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there are some aspects about you that are crucial for admission which aren’t numerical. They are qualitative, not quantitative.</p>
      <h1 id="how-you-can-be-what-they-want">How You Can Be What They Want</h1>
      <p>Imagine you’re a recruiter, and you’re handed an application to review. You’re not going to be able to look over absolutely everything in their application. You want to look for characteristics that tell you whether someone is a good fit for your school, and you want to do it efficiently.</p>
      <div class="pic-container">

      	<div class="pic-title">
      		<p>Quality vs Quantity</p>
      	</div>
      </div>
      <h2 id="quantitative">Quantitative</h2>
      <p>Pretty straightforward: Get good grades and test scores. Don’t stress too much…</p>
      <p>Although most colleges don’t like publishing raw cutoff scores, it’s important to know who you’re competing with. You’re competing with the nerdiest nerds in the world. I don’t think it’s necessary to have a 1600 to get in, but you certainly are doing yourself a disservice if you have below a 1500. You want to get the best scores possible on your exams, but don’t freak out if they’re less than perfect. Just make sure you don’t take the SAT/ACT too much, it could really start messing with your mental health.</p>
      <p>Also, make sure your subject tests are on the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
      <p>As for your grades, this is a little bit less lenient. I would highly recommend having nothing lower than a 3.9. Unless there was some extenuating life circumstance, or you were busy doing something more important, there is really no reason to have a shit GPA.</p>
      <h2 id="qualitative">Qualitative</h2>
      <p>Now this is the juicy part. Remember when I said that top colleges create world-class people? Well, let’s rephrase that a little bit with the extra context we have. Maybe these schools don’t actually turn bright students into world-class people. Rather, their admits are the type of people who show signs of being world-class material AND are smart. Now, how do we show that we’re world-class material? Well, this is where my earlier point of passion comes in. Once more, you do not need to cure a disease or invent something incredibly useful to get in. Although if you did that would certainly help!</p>
      <h1 id="the-actual-point-of-the-essay">The Actual Point of the Essay</h1>
      <p>You need to show you are goal-oriented and that you’re capable of finishing a long-term job and sticking to your guns. Your written application materials have to document that you DID SOMETHING that was for more than a trophy or a grade. There are as many valid examples as there are alumni at these schools. Each one of them did something other than get good grades and scores. That something is what helped get them in. Let me reiterate, good grades and test scores will NOT get you in.</p>
      <p>Look at this snippet from the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/the-mitadmissions-mission/">MIT Admissions mission statement</a>:</p>
<pre>
The MIT Office of Admissions enrolls a talented and diverse undergraduate student body
composed of some of the world’s most intelligent and creative individuals interested 
in an education centered on science and technology.

The students we enroll add to a vibrant campus community and will become the leaders 
and innovators of our global society.

We uphold a commitment to meritocracy and fair access to our admissions process for 
students from all backgrounds.
</pre>
      <p>Also take a look at <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/">what they look for</a></p>
      <p>They basically gave you the answer. They want you to be talented (i.e. “world-class”). They want you to be diverse not just in test scores/grades, but in experiences and interests. This relates back to having a genuine interest in something. An MIT-specific criterion is for you to be able to benefit from a science education. I understand I could have just given you these links in the first place and avoided this whole essay. However, I think that guiding you through the reasoning and statistics behind applications, all while offering personal advice is a more down-to-earth and effective way of communicating.</p>
      <h2 id="hello-im-anthony">Hello, I’m Anthony</h2>
      <p>Once you read <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hello_im_anthony/">this</a>, I’m sure you’ll know what kind of person they’re looking for.</p>
      <p>Now, obviously you don’t have to work for the corporate internet. You don’t need to have a web developer job as a child. And you really don’t need to be interested in what he liked. You just need to have the same quality of intense interest and passion that overcomes any obstacle. That’s the kind of fire you need to show these people what you’re made of. I think that Anthony is one of those “clear admits” that comes by once in a blue moon. I don’t think that the average MIT admit did anything as cool as this guy. However, they proved that they belonged there by doing SOMETHING. And that something is up to you to find. But whatever it is, it has to show that you share the values of MIT and that both you and the school would benefit from your being there.</p>
      <p>Now, take this advice and apply it to whatever discipline and school you’re applying to. And there you have it.</p>
      <h1 id="how-you-may-be-wasting-your-time">How You May Be Wasting Your Time</h1>
      <p>Of course, I should share my thoughts on what might be wasting your time and energy.</p>
      <h2 id="doing-the-bare-minimum">Doing the Bare Minimum</h2>
      <p>For context, I was on a robotics team for most of high school. And the thing about extracurriculars in high school is that they’re full of passionate individuals, but also some people are just there because their parents have no one else to leave them for the afternoon. Even worse, some people are there because they think it’ll be their ticket to a top college. They think they can just rack up those volunteer hours and get into Harvard. Almost as though it’s some ticket system like at Peter Piper’s. Fill out some checklist of arbitrary activities and wait to get into a school.</p>
      <p>Some people will thin themselves out across several activities to the point where they are barely committing to anything. This happened to me in my freshman year, I founded a programming club, tried volunteering, and also tried editing the school newspaper. I thought it would be awesome and that it would look cool. It did not work out at all. I dropped the newspaper thing almost immediately. And the programming club fell apart because only a handful of people ever showed up. Although I eventually joined the Bit Buckets, a local robotics team that I engaged in a lot.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>, 80% of the people do 20% of the work and 20% of people do about 80% of the work. Usually on my team it was the leadership group and some devoted newbies that carried everyone else. A lot of people were simply there to talk with friends. It doesn’t help that we met on Sundays either, so some people would also go there to do homework and nothing else. Anyways, my point is that you should fully commit to whatever it is you like to do. You shouldn’t just go to a club meeting to hang out with people and chill. That’s a stupid waste of time and shows that you clearly don’t value the activity as much as others.</p>
      <p>You might ask, “How will the admissions people know that I don’t really care?”</p>
      <p>It all shows in your application essays and recommendation letters. You’re going to end up writing an essay about how you liked “building robots” and “learning how to code”. You might brag incessantly about how the team won trophies and stuff like that. But you won’t be able to talk about how you grew as a person. You didn’t contribute anything beyond just being another person on the roster. Admissions officers are really good at filtering out uncommitted people. You know why? Because <em>anyone</em> can tell if you’re committed. Do you think Anthony just did what he did because his parents told him to? His counselor? Nope, he just really wanted to do it and so he did.</p>
      <p>You need to commit to something and become really good at it, this will show them just how good you are.</p>

      	</div>
      </div>
      <p>This is something I saw in my selective and top-ranked high school. Almost everyone aiming for the Ivy League convinced themselves that it was OK to rarely sleep and suffer chronic stress. Why? Because the sheer volume of work and filler extracurriculars (literature clubs, gaming clubs, band, orchestra) somehow justified a lack of passion and enjoyment. It was just part of the “lifestyle”. Just a quick disclaimer by the way. I’m not trying to say that everyone else at my high school lacked a life other than academics. Obviously, everyone has interests and hobbies that just don’t come up at school. But I do think that there was an unhealthy obsession with “the grind” and trying to look as impressive as possible to colleges by doing meaningless things.</p>
      <p>I’m also not trying to make another version of the NPC meme, that’s cringe. I think everyone has their own complicated issues to deal with and I’m not trying to trivialize their struggle. I’m simply stating the attitudes I’ve seen and what I think about the whole topic.</p>

      <h2 id="focusing-too-much-or-too-little-on-grades">Focusing Too Much or Too Little on Grades</h2>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong, get good grades. Don’t you dare take this essay as an excuse to fail a class.</p>

      <p>At the same time, don’t freak out over a B in a topic unrelated to your intended major.</p>
      <h2 id="focusing-too-much-or-too-little-on-test-scores">Focusing Too Much or Too Little on Test Scores</h2>
      <p>Again, get good scores!</p>
      <div class="pic-container">

      </div>
      <p>“TeSt ScOrEs ArE aN oUtDaTeD mEtRiC!!! They don’t actually show how smart you are!!!”</p>
      <p>Although I think that test scores are an ineffective way of measuring aptitude, people who tend to do well on standardized exams also tend to do well in life overall. Clearly, they don’t want to admit someone who can’t handle the workload. In my opinion, standardized tests don’t test <em>what</em> you know. The questions are just basic Trig and Pre-Calc that every senior should know. Rather, they are a sort of meta-test in my opinion.</p>
      <p>In other words, are you good at grinding for a test score if you have to? Do you have the cognitive ability to apply what you already know under time and rule constraints? If you have a bad score, chances are you just can’t handle such constraints. It’s unfortunate, but it’s just something we have to put up with until they become entirely optional. On the bright side, many top colleges are starting to ignore test scores.</p>
      <h2 id="focusing-too-much-on-meaningless-extracurriculars">Focusing Too Much on Meaningless Extracurriculars</h2>
      <p>For the love of God don’t join Band or Orchestra if you don’t actually want to play an instrument. If you’re even part Asian like me, then I’m terribly sorry because I know your parents are probably forcing you. Becoming world-class at an instrument may get you into a good artsy school or a good orchestra, so that’s a plus if you’re into that.</p>
      <p>Another example is joining a variation of a “rotary club”. It’s sort of a community service club where you meet once a week and occasionally do activities at the local park or something. Maybe the occasional food drive. But you just do what you’re told for four years. You all know what I’m talking about. Anyways, don’t write about doing that on your application unless you’re in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>But yeah, if you find yourself in an extracurricular activity that you absolutely hate, just leave. It’s a literal waste of time. Time you could spend on what you want to do.</p>
      <h2 id="focusing-too-little-on-meaningful-extracurriculars">Focusing Too Little on Meaningful Extracurriculars</h2>
      <p>This ties back into my first point about complacency and not putting in enough effort. If you want to have a strong application, then you should take your interests seriously. Make sure that you’re moving up in the organization and making meaningful impacts on the world around you through that. Don’t settle for a simple membership. Become a leader.</p>
      <h2 id="applying-to-top-colleges-despite-having-major-issues">Applying to Top Colleges Despite Having Major Issues</h2>
      <p>Listen, this is going to rub some people the wrong way.</p>
      <p>If you are obese, depressed, anxious, or have any form of mental/physical health issues that may prevent you from succeeding in these environments, then seriously reconsider applying. I don’t think you should be committing yourself to an exceptionally demanding school if you struggle with these things. The application process itself is also just stressful and I think you would be better off straightening out your problems before taking on any additional commitments.</p>
      <p>I had a friend who was quite unhealthy and depressed, and she convinced herself that she could go to an Ivy League if she just got straight A’s and a 1600 on her SAT. I think she achieved the 4.0, but her four years of highschool just consisted of studying, playing video games, watching anime, and eating excessive amounts of junk food. She ended up going to a local university despite her efforts and didn’t get many scholarships. I’m not trying to trivialize her struggle, but it illustrates my point. Maybe she was really into anime or something and it was an outlet for her, I really don’t know.</p>
      <p>Realize that you need help and get it. Taking care of yourself and finding the time to pursue meaningful activities is an important and worthwhile endeavor. It’s awfully hard to be passionate about something and fully commit to it if you have these problems.</p>
      <h2 id="reading-this">Reading This</h2>
      <p>So, there’s an interesting Catch-22 inherent in this essay.</p>
      <p>You want to get into a good school.</p>
      <p>To get into a good school, you need to be passionate about something.</p>
      <p>You have to gain experience and intuition in something to call yourself passionate.</p>
      <p>Passion is an intense form of interest.</p>
      <p>You need to be mildly interested in something to <em>want</em> to gain experience and intuition in it.</p>
      <p>You kinda have to be passionate in something to become more passionate.</p>
      <p>So… not only do you need to already have an interest, but you should also start this early on in highschool so that you have time to get good. My suggestion is to stop reading self-help stuff and find yourself a hobby. Something to get good at. Take a list of all your interests and start committing a chunk of time to them. You don’t need a desire to get good just yet. Simply work on them. Eventually, you’ll filter out the meaningless activities and keep the ones that mean a lot to you. I found robotics by going through a lot of clubs in my freshman year, it just takes time to find the right thing.</p>
      <p>Close this tab and go do something.</p>

      <p>Honestly, you can’t 100% trust me. Again, I have no affiliation with any college admissions department.

But I don’t really care because I’m talking from experience and the actual posts written by these schools.</p>
