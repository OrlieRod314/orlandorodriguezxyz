                <p>Before I start this, I just want to say that I am in no way affiliated with any admissions department nor do I work for a university. Rather, this is written from what I’ve seen online, in my own experience, and with my friends as we applied to college a little over a year ago. I applied to a lot of good schools and got accepted, rejected, and waitlisted from a ton of them. Now I attend the University of Arizona with a surplus in scholarship money (I literally get paid to go here on top of free food and housing).</p>
                <p>So, I think I at least can say a couple of things about getting into a good school. I honestly wish I read this as I started high school, because then I think I would have had more choices (although who knows, I might have decided to stay here anyways.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
                    </div>
		<div class="container main">
            <h2 id="addressing-assumptions">Addressing Assumptions</h2>
                    <p>I’m assuming that you want to go to a school like MIT or Harvard because it’s fancy and prestigious. That’s totally not a bad reason to want to go to a school. Every smart kid wants to be an elite intellectual.</p>
                    <p>Although this isn’t a bad reason to want to go, it’s definitely not a healthy mindset because it implies that the student debt and other investments are worth the prestige. Before we start, let me say that you should always remember one simple fact: No one cares where you went to college!</p>
                    <p>Five years from now, this won’t matter. You’ll have a cool job <strong>not</strong> because of the school you went to, but because of your skillset. You develop your skillset outside of class as well, not just in front of a teacher. You’re responsible for your success in life and an institution can’t promise you success. They can probably give you an alumni network and <strong>maybe</strong> an internship program or some undergraduate research (which you can do at basically any university). You shouldn’t think of MIT, Harvard, or Stanford as some life goal that you have to devote every waking moment to. That’s a surefire way to burn out early and be left with crippling debt. It’s also just sad as fuck if you don’t make it despite all the effort.</p>
                    <p>So first, stop caring so much about making your parents proud. If they’re good parents, they won’t care as long as you’re happy. If they’re not good parents, you shouldn’t care what they think. If they’re mediocre, they’ll be slightly disappointed but stop caring after like a week.</p>
                    <p>So, with that established I want to lay down my other important point: If you follow this advice with the sole intention of getting into a good school and nothing else, you <strong>will</strong> waste your time. It’s important to make sure that you’re doing these things because you would do them regardless of where you’re applying.</p>
                    <p>There’s also something I want to point out that may rub you in a very bad way. If you’re weeks away from your application deadline, or well into your senior year, just stop. Just stop reading this, finish applying and move on. I don’t think the advice past this point is useful if you’re a senior. It will definitely help if you’re an incoming Junior, but ideally you would be an incoming freshman with a fresh slate.</p>
                    <p>One last point that may rub you even worse: Anyone can get into these schools. But many people don’t put in the effort to get ther. This in essence means that if you apply and don't get accepted, then it was at least partially your fault for not trying hard enough. I'm also sick and tired of hearing the classic cope of, "I didn't get in because of affirmative action". Sure, maybe affirmative action had something to do with it, but at the same time I highly doubt your rejection came down to that.</p>
                <h2 id="why-these-schools-exist">Why These Schools Exist</h2>
                    <p>Top schools are top schools for a reason. They produce a high volume of successful and influential people who become high-level workers and contribute greatly in their respective fields. These schools want to maximize their influence in the world, and so they will produce highly skilled and ambitious graduates. Everyone trusts publications released by these institutions because their professors are <em>world-class</em>. That’s a word I’m going to be using a lot.</p>
                    <p><em>“World-class”</em> means in this context: Someone who has devoted so much time and effort to their field that their prowess is rarely rivaled. You’ll see why this is relevant.</p>
                <h2 id="what-they-want">What They Want</h2>
                    <p>Now, given what these schools output, you know that the input (an admitted student) has to be better than the average student. You know that there’s something that sets the admits apart from the rejects. To investigate further, we need to see what the profile of an average admit looks like. Let’s take a look at some statistics across the board. How about some <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats/">MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Harvard-admission-requirements">Harvard</a> admission statistics?</p>
                    <p>With just two examples you kinda get the point. You don’t need to be some test-taking wizard to get in. Pay attention to those statistics. Sure, the SAT Math bottom 25th percentile for MIT was a high 790… but look at the Reading section! <strong>25% of MIT admits got below a 730 in the Reading section of the SAT.</strong> Clearly, there was something in them that made the admissions officers say, “They’re in!”. So, we have officially dispelled the myth of needing to be a perfect test taker and absolute genius to get in.</p>
                    <p>They admit people based on things other than exclusively numbers. Well, the only thing they have to judge you by is your application. What’s included in your application? Test scores, grades, essays, letters of recommendation, sometimes an interview, and maybe some extra materials or something.</p>
                    <p>Clearly, there are some aspects about you that are crucial for admission which aren’t numerical. They are qualitative, not quantitative.</p>
                    <h2 id="how-you-can-be-what-they-want">How You Can Be What They Want</h2>
                    <p>Imagine you’re a recruiter, and you’re handed an application to review. You’re not going to be able to look over absolutely everything in their application. You want to look for characteristics that tell you whether someone is a good fit for your school, and you want to do it efficiently.</p>

				<p>Quality vs Quantity</p>
				</div>
			</div>
                    <h3 id="quantitative">Quantitative</h3>
                    <p>This is going to be rather short. Pretty straightforward: Get good grades and test scores. Don’t stress too much…</p>
                    <p>Although most colleges don’t like publishing raw cutoff scores, it’s important to realize who you’re competing with. You’re competing with the nerdiest nerds in the world. I don’t think it’s necessary to have a 1600 to get in, but you certainly are doing yourself a disservice if you have below a 1500.</p>
                    <p>You want to get the best scores possible on your exams, but don’t freak out if they’re less than perfect. Just make sure you don’t take the SAT/ACT too much, it could really start messing with your mental health.</p>
                    <p>Also, make sure your subject tests are on the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
                    <p>As for your grades, this is a little bit less lenient. I would highly recommend having nothing lower than a 3.9. Unless there was some extenuating life circumstance, or you were busy doing something more important, there is really no reason to have a shit GPA.</p>
                    <h3 id="qualitative">Qualitative</h3>
                    <p>Now this is the juicy part. Remember when I said that top colleges create world-class people? Well, let’s rephrase that a little bit with the extra context we have. Maybe these schools don’t actually <strong>turn</strong> bright students into world-class people. Rather, their admits are the type of people who show signs of being world-class material AND are smart.</p>
                    <p>This is interesting. Now, how do we show that we’re world-class material? Well, this is where my earlier point of passion comes in. Once more, you do <strong>not</strong> need to cure a disease or invent something incredibly useful to get in. Although if you did that would certainly help!</p>
                    <p>Here we go. The actual point of the essay. Let’s start another section…</p>
                <h2 id="the-actual-point-of-this-essay">The Actual Point of This Essay</h2>
                    <p>You need to show you are goal-oriented and that you’re capable of finishing a long-term job and sticking to your guns. Your written application materials have to document that you DID SOMETHING that was for more than a trophy or a grade. There are as many valid examples as there are alumni at these schools. Each one of them did something other than get good grades and scores. That something is what helped get them in.</p>
                    <p>Let’s look at this snippet from the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/the-mitadmissions-mission/">MIT Admissions mission statement</a>:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>The MIT Office of Admissions enrolls a talented and diverse undergraduate student body composed of some of the world’s most intelligent and creative individuals interested in an education centered on science and technology.</p>
                    <p>The students we enroll add to a vibrant campus community and will become the leaders and innovators of our global society.</p>
                    <p>We uphold a commitment to meritocracy and fair access to our admissions process for students from all backgrounds.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Also take a look at <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/">what they look for</a></p>
                    <p>They basically gave you the answer. They want you to be talented (i.e. “world-class”). They want you to be diverse not just in test scores/grades, but in experiences and interests. This relates back to having a genuine interest in something. An MIT-specific criterion is for you to be able to benefit from a science education.</p>
                    <p>I understand I could have just given you these links in the first place and avoided this whole essay. However, I think that guiding you through the reasoning and statistics behind applications, all while offering personal advice is a more down-to-earth and effective way of communicating.</p>
                    <h3 id="hello-im-anthony">Hello, I’m Anthony - An Example of Dedication</h3>
                    <p>Once you read <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hello_im_anthony/">this</a>, I’m sure you’ll know what kind of person they’re looking for.</p>
                    <p>Now, obviously you don’t have to work for the corporate internet. You don’t need to have a web developer job as a child. And you really don’t need to be interested in what he liked. You just need to have the same quality of intense interest and passion that overcomes any obstacle. That’s the kind of fire you need to show these people what you’re made of.</p>
                    <p>I think that Anthony is one of those “clear admits” that comes by once in a blue moon. I don’t think that the average MIT admit did anything as cool as this guy. However, they proved that they belonged there by doing SOMETHING. And that something is up to you to find. But whatever it is, it has to show that you share the values of MIT and that both you and the school would benefit from your being there.</p>
                    <p>Now, take this advice and apply it to whatever discipline and school you’re applying to. And there you have it.</p>
                <h2 id="how-you-may-be-wasting-your-time">How You May Be Wasting Your Time</h2>
                    <p>Of course, I should share my thoughts on what might be wasting your time and energy. #7 will <strong>SHOCK</strong> you!</p>
                    <h3 id="doing-the-bare-minimum">Doing the Bare Minimum</h3>
                    <p>I noticed this mostly in a robotics team I was a part of when I was in high school. You would have all the hard workers diligently devoting themselves to a project, and then you would turn around to see a group of around seven people playing games on their phone.</p>
                    <p>This ties into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>. 80% of the people do 20% of the work. 20% of people do about 80% of the work. Usually on my team it was the leadership group and some devoted newbies that carried everyone else. A lot of people were simply there to talk with friends. It doesn’t help that we met on Sundays either, so some people would also go there to do homework and not do anything else.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, my point is that you should fully commit to whatever it is you like to do. You shouldn’t just go to a club meeting to hang out with people and chill. That’s a stupid waste of time and shows that you clearly don’t value the activity as much as others.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>“Okay, but how will the admissions officers tell that I don’t care?”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Look at it this way, in the middle of your senior year you’re going to be sitting at your desk writing application essays. You're going to write an essay about how you enjoyed “building robots” and “learning how to code”. Maybe you did an interesting side project or something. That’s freaking cool. Maybe you’ll put it in your additional application materials and share it with your interviewer the next week. You tiredly submit your application to MIT and go back to playing Fortnite with your friends. You get tired and pass out, waking up at noon to play more video games.</p>
                    <p>As you’re doing this, your more devoted teammate is staying up all night reprogramming the robot, debugging everything, and making sure that it works. Not only that, but he’s also in the middle of working on his numerous software projects, running a web server, and getting ready for an athletic competition the next weekend. The numerous insights that he’s gained by approaching life with this enthusiasm will show in his essays. He doesn’t do this to fake his way into MIT, he does this because he wants to.</p>

                    <p>This is something I saw in my selective and top-ranked high school. Almost everyone convinced themselves that it was OK to rarely sleep and suffer chronic stress. Why? Because the sheer volume of work and filler extracurriculars (literature clubs, gaming clubs, band, orchestra) somehow justified a lack of passion and enjoyment. It was just part of the “lifestyle”.</p>
                    <p>Just a quick disclaimer by the way. I’m not trying to say that everyone else at my high school lacked a life other than academics. Obviously, everyone has interests and hobbies that just don’t come up at school. But I do think that there was an unhealthy obsession with “the grind” and trying to look as impressive as possible to colleges by doing meaningless things.</p>
                    <p>I’m also not trying to make another version of the NPC meme, that’s cringe. I think everyone has their own complicated issues to deal with and I’m not trying to trivialize their struggle. I’m simply stating the attitudes I’ve seen and what I think about the whole topic.</p>

                    <p>Honestly just shut up. For every five self-proclaimed programming geniuses, there’s an actual one with good grades.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, don’t freak out over a B in a topic unrelated to your intended major.</p>

                    <p>Shut up. The SAT and ACT are the closest things we have to nation-wide college entrance exams. There also needs to be some baseline for data collection. Clearly, they don’t want to admit someone who can’t handle the workload. Standardized tests don’t test WHAT you know. The questions are just basic Trig and Pre-Calc that every senior should know. Rather, they are a sort of meta-test in my opinion. In other words, are you good at grinding for a test score if you have to? Do you have the cognitive ability to apply what you already know under time and rule constraints? If you have a bad score, chances are you just can’t handle the studying and workload of a top college.</p>
                    <h3 id="focusing-too-much-on-meaningless-extracurriculars">Focusing Too Much on Meaningless Extracurriculars</h3>
                    <p>For the love of God don’t join Band or Orchestra if you don’t actually want to play an instrument. If you’re even part Asian like me, then I’m terribly sorry because I know your parents are probably forcing you. Becoming world-class at an instrument may get you into a good artsy school or a good orchestra, so that’s a plus if you’re into that.</p>
                    <p>Another example is joining a variation of a “rotary club”. It’s sort of a community service club where you meet once a week and occasionally do activities at the local park or something. Maybe the occasional food drive. But you just do what you’re told for four years. You all know what I’m talking about. Anyways, don’t write about doing that on your application unless you’re in charge of the club.</p>
                    <p>But yeah, if you find yourself in an extracurricular activity that you absolutely hate, just leave. It’s a literal waste of time. Time you could spend on what you want to do.</p>
                    <h3 id="focusing-too-little-on-meaningful-extracurriculars">Focusing Too Little on Meaningful Extracurriculars</h3>
                    <p>This ties back into my first point about complacency and not putting in enough effort. If you want to have a strong application, then you should seriously take your interests seriously. Make sure that you’re moving up in the organization and making meaningful impacts on the world around you through that. Don’t settle for a simple membership. Become a leader.</p>
                    <h3 id="applying-to-top-colleges-despite-having-major-issues">Applying to Top Colleges Despite Having Major Issues</h3>
                    <p>Listen, this is going to rub some people the wrong way.</p>
                    <p>If you are obese, depressed, anxious, or have any form of mental/physical health issues that may prevent you from succeeding in these environments, then just stop applying and get help. I don’t think you should be committing yourself to an exceptionally demanding school if you struggle with these things.</p>
                    <p>Realize that you need help and get it. It’s awfully hard to be passionate about something and fully commit to it if you have these problems.</p>
                    <h3 id="reading-this">Reading This</h3>
                    <p>So, there’s an interesting Catch-22 inherent in this essay.</p>
                    <p>You are reading this because you want to know how to get into a good school. As I said, they want to see passion.</p>
                    <p>Readers don’t have enough experience to be passionate about something. But you need to be passionate about something to want to get experience in it. Not only that, but you need to do this early on in high school so you don’t join the game too late.</p>
                    <p>My suggestion is to stop reading self-help stuff and find yourself a hobby. Something to get good at. Take a list of all your interests and start committing a chunk of time to them. You don’t need a desire to get good just yet. Simply work on them. Eventually, you’ll filter out the meaningless activities and keep the ones that mean a lot to you.</p>
                    <p>Put this down and go do something.</p>
                    <h3 id="why-you-can-trust-my-advice">Why You Can Trust My Advice</h3>
                    <p>Honestly, you can’t 100% trust me. Again, I have no affiliation with any college admissions department. And I 100% bet that someone could find extremely specific cases in which my advice completely flops. But I don’t really care because I’m talking from experience and the actual posts written by these schools.</p>

                <p>One final disclaimer: Nowhere did I say that you SHOULD want to go to a highly selective school. Everyone has different ambitions in life and going to a top school doesn’t guarantee you anything. I’m just tired of seeing high schoolers waste their time trying to get into these schools when all they do is study and play an instrument.</p>
                <p>I think that your college search will become more satisfying and liberating if you try and look for a good match instead of prestige.</p>
                <p>Also, if you’re already doing these things and want to go to a top school anyways, then good for you! Remember that there’s no formula for getting in, and you’re always better off doing what you like instead of what you’re told.</p>
