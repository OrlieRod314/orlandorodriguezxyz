	Bryan Bielawa and I are good friends and are involved in the [U of A Cybercats](https://cybercats.io/). We wrote this article to compile all the resources we found useful.
abstract: |
	You'll find plenty of resources for cryptography and steganography. These were compiled during the 2020 [NCL](https://nationalcyberleague.org/) season and will continue to be updated as we participate more in the program. We've also included some usage guides, although you should reference the original materials for further reading.
