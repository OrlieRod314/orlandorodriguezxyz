				<p>Here is my resume. Feel free to use the LaTeX code below. I will be updating the resume regularly.</p>

			<h2 id="resume">Resume</h2>
   <p>I made the resume entirely in LaTeX. It has useful links to my sites and an explanation of things Iâ€™ve done, as a resume should.</p>
			<iframe src="/docs/resume.pdf" width="100%" height="1200"></iframe>

   <h2 id="source-code">Source Code</h2>
   <p>The <a href="/docs/resume.tex">source code</a> will be updated as well as I add more things to the resume.</p>
   <h3 id="things-to-note">Things to Note</h3>
   <p>I defined some macros such as school name, town, contact onformation, and personal sites. I intend for other users to replace the info with theirs.</p>
   <p>I also defined a function to create a resume entry. This is an easy way of appending details without having to manually format in-line. It cleanly divides the information vertically so that all the relevant details are on the left and the date/location is to the side.</p>
   <p>And as always, you can clearly see that I am a fan of smallcaps.</p>

				<p>Feel free to modify and distribute this resume template however you want. I would appreciate it if I were credited somewhat though. Perhaps a reference to my site or something.</p>
