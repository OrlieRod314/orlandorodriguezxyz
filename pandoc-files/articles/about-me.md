	Who am I and what do I do? A collection of contact information, personal details, and personal projects I've been pursuing. A couple of details about my interests and hobbies that I don't really post about anywhere else.

	Starting and maintaining a website has helped me write about my hobbies and interests without falling into the social media trap. When making the website, I wanted to have a clear division between my personal life and other hobbies. Because of this, I have divided my site into three parts: A resume site for employers to quickly find my resume and links, a main site for articles about my thoughts and projects, and a personal blog for personal stuff.

Since the site's inception, I've tried to maintain a clear separation between the personal and professional aspects of my life. I will keep all my personal details on this singular page. It's easier to keep track of what people know about me if it's all in one place that I control.

# School

I am currently a student at the University of Arizona studying Computer Science, as well as Statistics & Data Science with a minor in Spanish. How do I have time to study two fields? Well that's because of the 52 credits I transferred from high school. So, although I am in my second year, I am a senior by credit definition.

Out of the two fields however, I definitely care more about Computer Science and do better in it as a result. I may get a minor in SDS if it doesn't go well. Currently I am in the Honors College. 

# Hobbies

## Coding and CyberSec

Software and Web Development are my favorite creative hobbies. I enjoy making software and content for others to enjoy and implement. On the side I may dabble in hobbyist electronics. I also enjoy learning languages and am fluent in English and Spanish. Cybersecurity is also an interesting hobby of mine, as I am part of a cyber security club on campus.

## Fencing

Aside from intellectual pursuits, I am also heavily involved in my school's fencing club. I am the secretary and site designer of [UA Wildcat Fencing](https://www.uawildcatfencing.com/). Although I am currently a U rank, I think I'm well on my way to earning a rank as soon as tournaments open up again.

We are an épée fencing team, though I would like it if we could introduce foil and saber fencing, but we just don't have the people to do it. 

## Other

I play airsoft consistently. Not much as of late however, because of the pandemic.

I am also an Osu! player and can consistently complete 4-stars. I use the S620 Gaomon tablet and Whitecat skin.

## Personality

According to the MBTI, I am an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality).

Big Five Personality Inventory:

- Openness to Experience: 3.9/3.9
- Conscientiousness: 4.8/3.4
- Extraversion: 2.9/3.0
- Agreeableness: 2.6/3.6
- Neuroticism: 4.0/2.9

# Contact

You can always email me at <orlandorodriguezosr@protonmail.ch>.

## PGP

Although I don't expect to find myself having to send secure messages any time soon, I think it would be a good idea to put this here just in case.

## External PC Specs

As of January 2021, I use a PC I built by myself. I have a 1440p Pixio main monitor, and an 1080p portrait mode monitor to the right side. I use the second monitor for scrolling through Discord or reading. Most of my peripherals are [Razer](https://www.razer.com/) brand, but my keyboard is a [GMMK](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/gmmk-full-brown-switch) from [Glorious PC Gaming Race](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/). I use a [TONOR TC-777](https://www.tonormic.com/collections/usb-microphones/products/tonor-tc-777-usb-microphone) microphone. 

## Internal PC Specs

My PC has a [3060Ti Nvidia CPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/), and an [AMD Ryzen 5600X CPU](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-5600x). 

## Software Stack

My CS workflow involves heavy use of Eclipse, VSCode, and Vim. I will usually program in Java.

My other courses and hobbies usually require me to use LaTeX to compile PDFs.

# Books

I like to read a lot, but it's inconvenient carrying around printed books all the time, which is why I bought myself a [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B075MWNNJG/). I would recommend the Paperwhite version, it has a higher resolution, is waterproof, and has an anti-glare screen. 

My favorite author is [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/), I especially enjoyed his works [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) and [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). 

# Music

I enjoy IDM and EDM music, especially the works of [Aphex Twin](https://aphextwin.warp.net/).
