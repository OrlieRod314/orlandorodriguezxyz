## Personal

### School

I am currently a student at the University of Arizona studying Computer Science, as well as Statistics & Data Science with a minor in Spanish. How do I have time to study two fields? Well thanks to the 52 credits I transferred from high school. So, although I am in my second year, I am a senior by credit definition. 

Out of the two fields however, I definitely care more about Computer Science and do better in it as a result. I may get a minor in SDS if it doesn't go well. Currently I am in the Honors College. However, graduating with Honors will be difficult as the requirements ignore AP credit for required classes. 

### Hobbies

Software and Web Development are my favorite creative hobbies. I enjoy making software and content for others to enjoy and implement. On the side I may dabble in hobbyist electronics. I also enjoy learning languages and am fluent in English and Spanish. Cybersecurity is also an interesting hobby of mine, as I am part of a cyber security club on campus.

Aside from intellectual pursuits, I am also heavily involved in my school's fencing club. I am the secretary and site designer of UA Wildcat Fencing, although the site isn't up yet as we haven't acquired the domain. Although I am currently a U rank, I think I'm well on my way to earning a rank as soon as tournaments open up again. 

I play airsoft consistently. Not much as of late however, because of the pandemic. 

I am also an Osu! player and can consistently complete 4-stars. I use the S620 Gaomon tablet and Whitecat skin. 

### Personality

According to the MBTI, I have an Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging [(INTJ)](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) personality. I like getting things done and being useful, so I guess I fit the definition. 

After doing some research, I realized I share personality types with some pretty interesting anime characters. Lelouch vi Britannia from Code Geass, and Light/Near from Death Note. I've always identified with these characters so I guess it makes sense. 

Big Five Personality Inventory:

- Openness to Experience: 3.9/3.9
- Conscientiousness: 4.8/3.4
- Extraversion: 2.9/3.0
- Agreeableness: 2.6/3.6
- Neuroticism: 4.0/2.9

## Contact

You can always email me at <orlandorodriguezosr@protonmail.ch>.

### PGP

Although I don't expect to find myself having to send secure messages any time soon, I think it would be a good idea to put this here just in case.

## Current Project

I’m currently working on a Debian-based Linux OS called [Orlix](https://www.orlandorodriguez.xyz/posts/orlix). It’s meant to emphasize a fast workflow for CS students.
