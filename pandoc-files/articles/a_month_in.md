    The mass adoption of online teaching as a response to the pandemic introduced a flurry of logistical issues for college students. 
	About a month into online school, I was concerned by my decrease in productivity and concentration. 
    Wanting to improve my grades and not succumb to my quarantine-induced laziness, I employed a heuristic for increasing productivity. 

    Along the way, I amassed a collection of useful tips for students struggling with online school.

Obviously, online school isn't all that bad. After all, you might not have to spend money on housing because all your classes are online. Another plus is that 
your classes might be asynchronous, so you can watch your videos whenever it's convenient. This all sounds good on paper, but I found that this can jeapordize 
someone's productivity. 

## The Dilemma

Now, what happened in my case may not apply to everyone, some people may just be really good at hunkering down for an online lecture. But I personally find it hard to
stay focused at home. 

I experienced a strange blending of home and school. I never felt like I left school or my room, I was constantly in a state of transition between the two. Obviously I felt this way
because my computer was on my desk in my room. But it's not like I had any other option. The other rooms at home were too distracting, and it's not like I can just go the library in
light of the pandemic. 

This lack of distinction, combined with the new difficulties of online school, caused me to burn out by the first round of tests. I knew something had to change.

## What Could be Done?

Well, as someone who tends to be very neurotic, I find it easy to worry too much about things. I countered this by developing a sort of heuristic for maximizing productivity when I feel
overworked or stressed. I determined that there are factors I can control such as my schedule and when I decide to do things. I also listed the factors I can't control, such as when 
my classes take place or what assignments I have to work on. 

Another relevant factor was willpower. I believe that willpower is something that can be trained and developed, but willpower alone is not a needed, sustainable, or feasible solution 
to life's problems.

I personally don't like doing things when I find them inconvenient. So the strategy of my heuristic is, put simply, to maximize the convenience of working and put obstacles in the way
of other activities unless my work is done. For example, I could make an account specifically for gaming on my laptop, and just transfer all my games there.
