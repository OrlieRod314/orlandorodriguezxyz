## Resume

I made the resume entirely in LaTeX. It has useful links to my sites and an explanation of things I've done, as a resume should. 

## Source Code

The [source code](/docs/resume.tex) will be updated as well as I add more things to the resume. 

### Things to Note

I defined some macros such as school name, town, contact onformation, and personal sites. I intend for other users to replace the info with theirs. 

I also defined a function to create a resume entry. This is an easy way of appending details without having to manually format in-line. It cleanly divides the information vertically so that all the relevant details are on the left and the date/location is to the side.

And as always, you can clearly see that I am a fan of smallcaps.
